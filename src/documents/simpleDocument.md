# Welcome to Flatfile

---

This is a Space. It's been configured with some basic options to help you get acquainted with the Flatfile Platform.

Let's begin by getting familiar with what you're seeing here in the Sidebar.

## Documents

You are reading a document called "About this Demo", it's been configured as the landing page of this Space and a shortcut to it is located at the top of your Sidebar.

## Data Checklist

Below any documents is your "Data checklist". Use this section to explore what the data in your Workbook is expected to look like.

## Files

Use the "Files" tab to upload files. You can also upload them directly into Sheets. Your Workbooks and Sheets are located below the divider in Sidebar.

## Secrets

Configuring Secrets is an administrative function. Use this section to securely store key-value pairs that can be used in the code supporting your Flatfile Spaces.

## Guests

As an administrator you may also invite collaborators to work with you in this Space in the "Manage guests" section. Their view will look a little different than yours. Try inviting yourself at an alias email to see the difference.

## Data

The Workbook currently configured in this Space contains two Sheets: **Contacts**, and **Countries**.

## Things you can do here

1. You can upload/download CSV files into and from each Sheet.
2. You can manually add records to each Sheet directly in the UI.
3. You can also manually adjust cells & records individually, or in bulk.
