Welcome, to Flatfile.

This is Basic Space, configured as an interactive tour to show you around.

Let's begin by first getting acquainted with what you're seeing here in the sidebar.

## Data Checklist

Use the Data Checklist to learn the data that will be expected in the Simple Workbook.

## Files

Use the Files screen to upload files. You can also upload them directly into Sheets.

## Collaborators

Invite a Guest to this Space. Their view will look a little different than yours. Try an alias email to see.

## Simple Workbook

The Simple Workbook contains two Sheets: **Contacts**, and **Countries**.

#### Things you can do here:

1. You can upload/download CSV files into and from each Sheet.
2. You can manually add records to each Sheet directly in the UI.
3. You can also manually adjust cells & records individually, or in bulk.

#### 1. Contacts (Sheet)

The **Contacts** Sheet is a very simple Sheet with one reference field, **Country**. It also has a few data validations.

#### 2. Countries (Sheet)

The **Countries** Sheet is where youâ€™ll add all of the countries you want to display in the dropdown menu in the first Sheet.
