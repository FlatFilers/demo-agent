# Ephemeral Document example

This is an example of an ephemeral Document. It is meant to provide a more focused, guided experience for your end users. This document does not appear in the sidebar of your Space, and it can only be accessed by visiting the URL directly.

Typically, you'd generate an ephemeral Document dynamically in response to an event or action, and redirect your users to it.
