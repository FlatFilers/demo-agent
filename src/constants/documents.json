But the Workbook itself is configured dynamically via the `space:configure` listener.\n\n## Initializing your dynamic configuration\n\nWith the above code running on our Agent, we simply create a new space taking care to include the `autoConfigure: true` parameter. This parameter triggers the publication of the `space:configure` event that we're listening for. But you can do far more than adding a Workbook.

You can also checkout the source code for this space in [Typescript](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink/blob/main/typescript/localization/index.ts) and in [Javascript](https://github.com/FlatFilers/flatfile-docs-kitchen-sink/blob/main/javascript/localization/index.js).\n\n## Making this Space\n\nThis Space has been configured with localization options.\n\nHere's a look at the code that was used to create it:\n\n```jsx\nimport api from \"@flatfile/api\";\nimport { Client, FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from \"@flatfile/listener\";\n\nexport default function flatfileEventListener(listener: Client) {\n  listener.filter({ job: \"space:configure\" }, (configure: FlatfileListener) => {\n    configure.on(\n      \"job:ready\",\n      async ({ context: { spaceId, environmentId, jobId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {\n        try {\n          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {\n            info: \"Job started.\",\n            progress: 10,\n          });\n\n          //Documents are using translation keys instead of hardcoding strings\n          const document = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {\n            title: \"myDocument.title\",\n            body: \"myDocument.body\",\n          });\n\n          //Setting the translation path for the space\n          await api.spaces.update(spaceId, {\n            metadata: {\n              sidebarConfig: {\n                defaultPage: {\n                  documentId: document.data.id,\n                },\n              },\n            },\n            translationsPath:\n              \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlatFilers/Platform-Translations/kitchen-sink/locales/en/translation.json\",\n          });\n\n\n          await api.workbooks.create({\n            spaceId,\n            environmentId,\n            ...\n          });\n\n          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {});\n        } catch (error: any) {\n          console.error(\"Error: \", error.stack);\n\n          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {\n            outcome: {\n              message: \":(\",\n            },\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Further documentation\n\nRead more about customizing your Space text [here](https://flatfile.com/docs/guides/localization).\n\n## Learn more about Flatfile by trying our [other demos](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started)\n",
  "metadataDocument": "# Store descriptive information or data that provides additional context\n\n---\n\nMetadata refers is data that provides information about other data. It offers context and details about a particular piece of data, helping to describe and organize it.\n\nMetadata can include various attributes such as the creation date, user, size, format, and more, depending on the context.\n\nIn essence, metadata helps in understanding and managing data. In Flatfile, you can store and retrieve additional data about an Environment, Space, Record, or Field without exposing it to end users.\n\n## Making this Space\n\nThis Space has been configured with Records that are decorated with metadata.\n\nHere's a look at the code that was used to create it:\n\n```jsx\nimport api from \"@flatfile/api\";\nimport { Client, FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from \"@flatfile/listener\";\nimport simpleWorkbook from \"../constants/workbook.json\";\nimport { metadataDocument } from \"../constants/documents.json\";\n\nexport default function flatfileEventListener(listener: Client) {\n  listener.filter({ job: \"space:configure\" }, (configure: FlatfileListener) => {\n    configure.on(\n      \"job:ready\",\n      async ({ context: { spaceId, environmentId, jobId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {\n        try {\n          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {\n            info: \"Job started.\",\n            progress: 10,\n          });\n\n          const { data } = await api.documents.create(spaceId, {\n            title: \"About this Metadata Demo\",\n            body: metadataDocument,\n          });\n\n          const documentId = data.id;\n          const spaceUpdateParams = {\n            metadata: {\n              sidebarConfig: {\n                defaultPage: {\n                  documentId,\n                },\n              },\n            },\n          };\n\n          await api.spaces.update(spaceId, spaceUpdateParams);\n\n          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {\n            outcome: {\n              message: \"Job completed.\",\n            },\n          });\n        } catch (error: any) {\n          console.error(\"Error: \", error.stack);\n\n          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {\n            outcome: {\n              message: \"Job error.\",\n            },\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nYou can see that after creating this Space, this Document is created, and then a Space update call is made to make this Document the default page of this Space.\n\nLike this example, Flatfile uses some values in the Metadata object to support your configurations, but the Metadata object is flexible and open, enabling you to add further details contextualizing your Environments, Spaces, Workbooks, Sheets, and Records.\n\n## Further documentation\n\nRead more about contextualizing your data with descriptive information [here](https://flatfile.com/docs/guides/metadata).\n\n## Learn more about Flatfile by trying our [other demos](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started)\n",
  "namespaceDocument": "# Create distinct experiences with namespaces\n\n---\n\nNamespaces provide the ability to limit the extent of influence over Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets. In situations where you want to differentiate between Flatfile experiences, you can configure your system to react solely when the event aligns with the designated namespaces.\n\nIn your Flatfile listener, when youâre monitoring for specific events, you can set your system to only respond if the event matches the assigned namespaces.\n\n## Making this Space\n\nThis very Space was configured using a Namespace.\n\nHere's a look at the code that was used to create it:\n\n```jsx\nimport namespace from \"namespace-demo\";\nimport another from \"other-demo\";\n\nimport { Client } from \"@flatfile/listener\";\n\nexport default function (listener: Client) {\n  listener.namespace([\"space:namespace-demo\"], namespace);\n  listener.namespace([\"space:another-demo\"], another);\n}\n```\n\nNotice that there are two listener configurations here:\n\n- `space:namespace-demo`\n- `space:another-demo`\n\nThe `space:namespace-demo` was triggered on the creation of this demo, while another demo, under another namespace will create with a different configuration, both running on the same agent\n\n## Further documentation\n\nRead more about narrowing the scope of Spaces, Workbooks, and Sheets [here](https://flatfile.com/docs/guides/namespaces).\n\n## Learn more about Flatfile by trying our [other demos](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started)\n",
  "secretsDocument": "# Securely store and use credentials\n\n---\n\nSecrets enable the secure sharing of credentials with listener implementations, all without requiring developers to have direct knowledge of the secret values in advance.\n\nThese values are established within the user interface but are accessed through the SDK or API.\n\n## Things you can do here\n\nIn the Developer Settings section, go to the Secrets tab of this space and check out the Secret that has been populated. This Secret can be accessed in your Listener and used to interact with external resources requiring credentials.\n\n## Making this Space\n\nThis Space has been configured with a Secret.\n\nHere's a look at the code that was used to create it:\n\n```jsx\nimport api from \"@flatfile/api\";\nimport { Client, FlatfileEvent, FlatfileListener } from \"@flatfile/listener\";\n\nexport default function flatfileEventListener(listener: Client) {\n  listener.filter({ job: \"space:configure\" }, (configure: FlatfileListener) => {\n    configure.on(\n      \"job:ready\",\n      async ({ context: { spaceId, environmentId, jobId } }: FlatfileEvent) => {\n        try {\n          await api.jobs.ack(jobId, {\n            info: \"Job started.\",\n            progress: 10,\n          });\n\n          await api.secrets.upsert({\n            environmentId,\n            spaceId,\n            name: \"My First Secret\",\n            value: \"My Super Secret Value\",\n          });\n\n          await api.jobs.complete(jobId, {\n            outcome: {\n              message: \"Job completed.\",\n            },\n          });\n        } catch (error: any) {\n          await api.jobs.fail(jobId, {\n            outcome: {\n              message: \"Job error.\",\n            },\n          });\n        }\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\n## Further documentation\n\nRead more about securely storing use credentials in your configuration [here](https://flatfile.com/docs/guides/secrets).\n\n## Learn more about Flatfile by trying our [other demos](https://platform.flatfile.com/getting-started)\n",
